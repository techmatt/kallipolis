%% This file creates the Item, ItemPacket, ItemFold, ItemEnvelope, and
%% ItemLabel datatypes, and creates macros for each.  These are for
%% various types of in-game items.
%%
%%%%%


%%%%%
%% Item macros are for normal item cards.
\DECLARESUBTYPE{Item}{TransElement}
\PRESETS{Item}{
  \FD\MYtext	{} %% longer text of item
  \FD\MYmark	{} %% possible contents of shaded ``mark'' on card
  \FD\MYbulky	{0} %% potential bulkiness
  \FD\MYcapacity{N/A} %% potential capacity
  \sd\MYlistmap	{\item\MYname\ifx\MYnumber\empty\else\ (\MYnumber)\fi}
  }


%%%%%
%% \prop
%% \unstash
%% \bulky{<number>}
%% \contain{<number>}
%%
%% \prop inside an Item macro labels the card as a prop.  \unstash
%% labels the card as unstashable.  \bulky{n} labels the card as
%% n-hands bulky.  \contain{n} labels the card with n-hands capacity.
\def\prop{%
  \append\MYmark{ ~PROP~ }}
\def\unstash{%
  \append\MYmark{ ~UNSTASHABLE~ }}
\def\bulky#1{%
  \s\MYbulky{#1}%
  \append\MYmark{\mbox{ ~\MYbulky-Hand~Bulky~ }}}
\def\contain#1{%
  \s\MYcapacity{#1}%
  \append\MYmark{\mbox{ ~\MYcapacity-Hand~Capacity~ }}}


%%%%%
%% ItemPacket macros are for item cards with an attached packet.
%% They are a subtype of Item.
\DECLARESUBTYPE{ItemPacket}{Item}
\PRESETS{ItemPacket}{
  \F\MYcontents
  }


%%%%%
%% ItemFold macros are for items represented by just a folded packet.
%% They are a subtype of ItemPacket, with the longer text and ``mark''
%% left blank, since they have no actual item card.
\DECLARESUBTYPE{ItemFold}{ItemPacket}
\PRESETS{ItemFold}{
  \s\MYmark{}
  }


%%%%%
%% ItemEnvelope macros are for items represented by just an envelope.
%% They are a subtype of ItemPacket, with the longer text and ``mark''
%% left blank, since they have no actual item card.
\DECLARESUBTYPE{ItemEnvelope}{ItemPacket}
\PRESETS{ItemEnvelope}{
  \s\MYmark{}
  }


%%%%%
%% ItemLabel macros are for small labels that would get used on
%% physreps, e.g. gun labels.  The ``mark'' is left blank, since
%% it isn't used for these.
\DECLARESUBTYPE{ItemLabel}{Item}
\PRESETS{ItemLabel}{
  \s\MYmark{}
  }


%%%%%
%% \icard[<extras>]{<name>}{<number>}{<text>}
%% \specialicard[<extras>]{<name>}{<number>}{<text>}{<mark>}
%% \itempacket[<extras>]{<name>}{<number>}{<text>}{<mark>}{<contents>}
%% \itemfold{<name>}{<number>}{<text>}{<contents>}
%% \itemenvelope{<name>}{<number>}{<text>}{<contents>}
%% \itemlabel{<name>}{<number>}{<text>}
%%
%% These are wrappers around \INSTANCE, useful for 1-shots.
%%
%% For \icard, \specialicard, and \itempacket, the optional <extras>
%% (in []'s) is for things like \unstash and \bulky{3}.  For example,
%% \icard[\prop\contain{2}]{..}{..}{..}{..} gives an item that has a
%% prop and 3-hands capacity.
%%
%% The last arg (#5) to \specialicard is for anything extra you may
%% want in the ``mark''
